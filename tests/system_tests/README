System Tests Guide
===================

Introduction
-------------

The system test framework tests the functionality of the entire app in the highest level. (In contrast to unit tests that tests only small number of building blocks out of the whole application). The purpose of system tests is to validate that all building blocks work together and that changes introduce don't break the functionality of the app.

Requirements:
-------------

* Rosetta Diagrams
* NodeJS >= 0.8
* Selenium Server ( d/l from http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list )
